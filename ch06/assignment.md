# Ch 6

Chapter 6 is an introduction to the most common data structures. This chapter introduces stacks, linked lists, queues, etc. The following labs and assignments are practices of these data structures.

## Assignments

**Lab 7:** These labs are a showcase of stacks and how to use them. The first lab takes a number like '1337' and reverses the order of the digits to '7331'. The second lab take a sentence like 'The quick brown fox. He jumped over the lazy dog.' and reverses the order of the words in a sentence.

**Project 05:** Create an interactive to-do list using a PriorityQueue data structure. The interactive test driver loop should have functions that:

1. add tasks
2. remove tasks by specific id
3. edit tasks
4. view a specific task
5. view the entire list of tasks
6. view the next task using an iterator

**Lab 8:** This lab utilizes linked lists as a way to organise flight schedules in a dystopian type airport setting. It should organize flights based off of a status either *scheduled* or *queued*, and also removes flights that have other problems with it. This LinkedList also takes into account a "president" and the ability to jump a queue using a LinkedList. CSV Files and scanners are also used.

**Project 6:** Use a Doubly Linked List to contain a directory of names and phone numbers associated with those names. Implement the use of a TreeSet to search for a specific name either at the head or tail of the Doubly Linked List.
