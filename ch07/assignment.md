# Ch 7

Chapter 7 talks about the hash data structures as well as some common searching and sorting algorithms. There's only one assignment in this chapter, and honestly doesn't cover a lot.

## Assignments

**Lab 9:** This lab showchases a spell checker for 'Alice in Wonderland' and 'War and Peace' from a .txt format. This lab mainly demonstrates the time difference between HashSet, TreeSet and AraryList classes in Java. The code scans the documents for misspelled words and checks them with a dictionary that is also imported to a .txt file. Finally, a stopwatch class allows the programmer to see the time difference of each set.
