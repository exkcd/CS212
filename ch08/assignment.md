# Ch 8

Chapter 8 focuses on the TreeSet, HashSet, SortedSet, and heaps of the Java programming language.

## Assignments

**Lab 10:** This lab showcases how the heap algorithm works and shorts through an array of numbers. Min heap and max heap are used.

**Project 7:** In this assignment, you will implement code to model a problem tree structure domain of your choice, whether it be an org chart, a restaurant menu (appetizers, main dishes, salads, desserts, etc), group-types of animals, etc. My take was types of sneks (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0arsPXEaIUY).
