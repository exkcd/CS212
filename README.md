# CS212
This repo stores my code snippets and projects from my time in my Data Structures & Algorithms class.

Most of this code is pretty useless and serves no purpose in real world applications. I'm publishing this code mainly to experiment with the Git command line as well as recording my progress in aforementioned class.


## Organization
Homework is organized into folders by chapters with a file called `assignment.md` that best describes problems, labs and challenges that were assigned.

The folder `experiments` hold random tested code that may or may not be useful to a certain degree.

### About the class
The course textbook that is being used is:

*Big Java: Late Objects* 2nd Edition by Cay S. Horstmann
