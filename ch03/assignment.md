# Ch 3

Chapter 3 takes a gander at Java inheritance and polymorphism. In these assignments, we are required to understnad the fundamentals of interfaces, inheritance and abstraction of data.

## Assignments

**Project 03:** Show that you understand the fundamentals of Java inheritance and abstract classes by listing facts about farm animals.

**Lab 4:** Create java classes for concrete geometric shapes such as Circle, Rectangle, Triangle, etc. with methods and members to allow the calculation of the area and perimeter of the shape.  The concrete shapes will implement the interface Shape. Use encapsulation such that primitive members are private and accessed using getters. Class attributes may be set using constructors or setters.
