# Ch 9

Chapter 9 focuses on Input/Output and Exception Handling using the java.io.File package to create, write, read, and delete certain files and directories. Chapter 9 also covers Java Serialization and Deserialization. Exception handling is explained using Java's try and catch blocks as well as implementation of the throw keyword.

## Assignments

**Project 8:** In this assignment, you will create a program that uses queues to simulate a busy airport with only one runway, that shares aircraft take-off, and landings. Your program will function as an automated air-traffic controller. Hopefully, you will do at least as well as some of the human-run airports that we have all experienced either pleasantly, or not so much.
